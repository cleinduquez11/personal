    "content": "There's this girl that really captivate my innocent heart. Sounds like it's unrequited right? But yeah, her intelligent is the sexiest part of her, she does mind riddle me everytime we got to talk. It's like I'm talking to a book, in which or whatever she says, i cant argue with it. I spent lots of days to figure her out. What the hell she likes, who the hell she idolized. And it turns out we're very much alike in many ways. She like the vibe of upbeat music with poetic lyrics. She automatically get magnetized by words in the lyrics, she thinks that the author was thinking about her, she thinks that she is the protagonist in that Music video in her mind. When she connects her current mood to each and every lyrics of her favorite artist that's when I find her so cute, made me smile all the time i saw her notes on her IG. Feels like it is her saying it to someone. I know that sometimes she's very unstable but damn she is so cute. Sometimes she is overconfident, sometimes not. She's really unstable so I'm worried that she won't live the life that she all ever wanted. I sometimes think to message her and uplift her spirit but i never did because I value her me time. She is taking her time to love and care herself. She has a lot of friends tho, so I was never that significant to her. But for me, she is shining this past few days coz she got to be herself despite all the bad season she have had. I only put this note because I kinda miss her. I know you'll soon read this but just how long would took you? Peace out.",

As a matter of fact, this is a letter that stored in my phone notes, also in which I kept every details of you. Every favorites, everything you like that i sometimes hate, your best laughs, best era, when jokes were not your thing till the day you made one and It really made me laugh, your addiction in written letters and mementos makes me wanna try this(letter) instead. The rare you that appreciate the way I sing, that even in my rough times, you cared. Though sometimes, we were'nt that perfect, there are things that i do not possess and I do lack in some ways, because I'm a shy type of a guy. Words were always my things and not actions. So here's my plan, I did colaborate with one of your trusted friends with a simple video greeting. Also, I bought you a cuddle buddy and a necklace in the cause that whether you are sleeping or awake, you'll always have me. You'll gonna like it, I'm confident about it",

Do you really think na magaling ka? Na alam mo lahat? Pakshet ka. Mahirap ka, dika mayaman para tamarin sa mga bagay bagay. Tapos papasok ka pa sa isang relasyon? wag! Kelangan maging breadwinner ka. Wala ka na ngang magulang e di ka pa magtino. Sa tingin mo mababago mo ang sarili mo dahil magaling ka? Hirap pala masapak ng reyalidad na pati sarili mo e unti-unti na ding nawawalan ng tiwala sayo eno. Yeah, the transition from my younger self to reality is so fucking hard. Every night nako naiiyak dahil I can't even do things para mabago ko yung family dinasty namin na pagiging mahirap. Damn it, I can't even look at my sister eyes at sabihin na okay lang tuwing nagtatanong sya noon kung ayos lang ba ako. Di naman ako naiingit sa ibang tao, masaya naman ako dati pero bat ngayon iba na. I can't even put a smile in my face anymore",
