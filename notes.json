Gonna flashback then, this will be the start for my plan for your birthday, just like you, I am also excited that you are gonna be turning 18. As a matter of fact, this is a letter that stored in my phone notes, also in which I kept every details of you. Every favorites, everything you like that i sometimes hate, your best laughs, best era, when jokes were not your thing till the day you made one and It really made me laugh, your addiction in written letters and mementos makes me wanna try this(letter) instead. The rare you that appreciate the way I sing, that even in my rough times, you cared. Though sometimes, we were'nt that perfect, there are things that i do not possess and I do lack in some ways, because I'm a shy type of a guy. Words were always my things and not actions. So here's my plan, I did colaborate with one of your trusted friends with a simple video greeting. Also, I bought you a cuddle buddy and a necklace in the cause that whether you are sleeping or awake, you'll always have me. You'll gonna like it, I'm confident about it",

Do you really think na magaling ka? Na alam mo lahat? Pakshet ka. Mahirap ka, dika mayaman para tamarin sa mga bagay bagay. Tapos papasok ka pa sa isang relasyon? wag! Kelangan maging breadwinner ka. Wala ka na ngang magulang e di ka pa magtino. Sa tingin mo mababago mo ang sarili mo dahil magaling ka? Hirap pala masapak ng reyalidad na pati sarili mo e unti-unti na ding nawawalan ng tiwala sayo eno. Yeah, the transition from my younger self to reality is so fucking hard. Every night nako naiiyak dahil I can't even do things para mabago ko yung family dinasty namin na pagiging mahirap. Damn it, I can't even look at my sister eyes at sabihin na okay lang tuwing nagtatanong sya noon kung ayos lang ba ako. Di naman ako naiingit sa ibang tao, masaya naman ako dati pero bat ngayon iba na. I can't even put a smile in my face anymore",
